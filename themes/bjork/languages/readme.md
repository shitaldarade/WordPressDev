# WARNING! Do not place your translation files here.

Any translation files placed here will be deleted when you update the theme.


## Translating the theme

1. Make a copy of the original `bjork.pot` file.
2. You need to rename the copied file now: add hyphen followed with [your language code locale](https://translate.wordpress.org/), and change file extension to "po". So, the British English file would be named `bjork-en_GB.po`, for example.
3. Use [Poedit](http://www.poedit.net/) to translate the file and export (save) translation in `mo` file format.
4. Upload translated `bjork-en_GB.mo` file into your WordPress languages directory, into `themes` folder (such as `/wp-content/languages/themes/bjork-en_GB.mo` - if the `themes` folder does not exist in your WordPress languages directory, create it).


## Contributing your translations back to the theme
